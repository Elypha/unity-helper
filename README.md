# Elypha's Unity Toolkit

Explore and find useful tools for everyday Unity development.

Currently includes:

- **Material Bulk Swapper**: replace materials or create bulk swap animation clips in a few clicks.
- **PhysBones Extractor**: help with daily work with PhysBones.
- **Full Toggle Generator**: a super toggle for nerds.

This is a curated list from packages I set up for my own projects. Please feel free to raise an issue on GitHub if you have any suggestions or questions.
